## What is Closeread?
Closeread is a Quarto format for **scrollytelling** — long-form pages where the text you scroll
through controls visual elements. You author in `.qmd` (Markdown + YAML), and GitHub Actions
builds everything into a static site.

:::{#cr-sticky}
This is sticky!

This text will be _stuck_ as you scroll up and down.

## How it works (in this repo)
1. GitHub Actions installs **Quarto** and **Closeread**.
2. It renders this project to static HTML/JS/CSS.
3. It publishes to **GitHub Pages** (`gh-pages` branch).

*Tip:* Edit this page right in GitHub → Commit → See the site update automatically.
