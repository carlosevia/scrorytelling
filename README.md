# # Closeread • Virginia Tech Starter

This repo demonstrates a **100% GitHub** workflow to build and host a
Closeread scrollytelling site with VT-flavored styling.

## One-time setup
1. Create a **public** repo and add these files at the root.
2. In **Settings → Actions → General**, set **Workflow permissions** to **Read and write**.
3. In **Settings → Pages**, choose **GitHub Actions** as the source.

## Update content
Edit `index.qmd` or add new `.qmd` pages, then commit. GitHub Actions
will rebuild and deploy to Pages.
